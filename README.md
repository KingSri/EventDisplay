# Welcome to Project Dekigoto.

## Project Overview:
*Dekigoto* (Japanese for event) is a community based event organizer. This product seeks to embrace and make community organization much more convenient. With a clean and minimalistic look, and a easy to use interface, users can make the most of Dekigoto. Users can like an event, add a comment to an event and view other comments on the same page, and even create their own events! With this kind of accessibility, who wants the complexity of google calendar?

## Unsolved problems/future features:

#### Unsolved problems:
- Event issue where second and consequent events on page have two different redirect links. One event takes you to the previous event, and the event detail link takes to proper link
-sometimes with different images, the index page will move back and forth

#### Future features:
- Add a sorting method to events to get them to filter by parameter (ex. date, city)
- Add grouping method to group users, and make event based groups
- Add a profile page for users, which will show user created Events
- Add external apis to provide map directions
- Add notifications to remind users about upcoming event
